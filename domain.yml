      I can help you find program satellite information. You can ask me things like: :: Look up CMG :: Search for attitude control :: What is the mass of the satellite? :: What is the latest attitude of the satellite?
      You can also ask generic questions about satellites like: :: How do satellites receive commands? :: How do satellites stay in orbit
